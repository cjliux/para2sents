In sports, unlike other businesses, companies have two bottom lines. Their owners want to win, of course, but they also want to make money, and the two are linked more loosely than you might think. You can make a lot of money with a bad team, as the N.F.L.’s Washington Redskins have done since 1999, when they were bought by Daniel Snyder. He has been a terrible owner, winning just 43 percent of his games, burning through seven head coaches, never reaching the Super Bowl and stubbornly refusing to change the team’s polarizing name. Yet if you judge him by the standards of any other business, he has been exemplary. The Redskins are the third-highest-grossing team in the N.F.L.; Snyder’s $800 million investment has more than tripled. If the team had public stockholders, they would be giving him a party.

given the exclusion of Brazilian youth with disabilities from sports , in 2008 the Ministry of Sport recommended organization of a pilot project under the Second Half Program through the National Secretariat of Educational Sport ( Secretaria Nacional de Esporte Educacional ) aimed at developing a proposing a methodology to assist youth with disabilities ( sight , hearing , intellectual , and physical ) in its centers .
in September 2010 , Right to Play participated in the World Conference on Early Childhood Education , hosted by UNESCO , the Government of the Russian Federation and the City of Moscow , and in a round table in New York on the theme of " The value of sport as a development tool , " hosted by the United Nations Office on Sport for Development and Peace .
and this is not only because many coaches of the national teams are , like in the good old days , " foreign mercenaries , " with this Cup 's Swiss guards including the Brazilian coaches of Japan and Portugal , the Swedish coach of England , and the French coach of Tunisia .

Ms. Williams and her sister Venus, of course, have crossed over into fashion, as has the French Open champion Maria Sharapova, who has collaborated on footwear and accessories with Cole Haan. In May, Novak Djokovic traded his Sergio Tacchini polos for outfits by Uniqlo, the Japanese fast-fashion retailer.
But where once the interest regularly came from Madrid or Milan, these days the voice on the other end of the line, teams say, is more likely to be calling from Beijing or Shanghai. And increasingly, the Chinese suitors are looking to buy only the best.
One result is that a steady flow of foreign players and coaches, lured by multimillion-dollar contracts, has poured into the Super League in recent years. In Shanghai, locals are reacting to an on-field improvement that has made the club one of the title favorites this season thanks, at least in part, to a significant investment in talent by the team’s owner, Shanghai International Port Group.
At a recent practice in Shanghai’s sprawling suburbs, Shenhua’s latest marquee signing, the Australian national team player Tim Cahill, bantered with the captain Giovanni Moreno of Colombia and several Chinese teammates in a mix of English, Chinese and Spanish. The team’s interpreters were kept busy as the goalkeepers’ coach, Juan Mesquida Garcia, barked rapid-fire instructions in Spanish, and the new manager, Francis Gillot, gave interviews to the news media in French.
With only Mexico and Cameroon left to play in the group stage, the Brazilians got past their biggest obstacle of the first round. They are smart enough to know that what awaits them after that in the knockout stage-likely Spain, the Netherlands or Chile-is going to require a different effort from players not named Oscar and Neymar. A little more samba soccer wouldn't hurt either.
Is it a good or bad sign that the marathon, which not long ago was a grass-roots affair for a band of enthusiasts in Central Park, is being compared to Israel, where security measures are likely the strictest in the world? Good that the city is protecting the marathoners and spectators. Bad that something that used to be such a relaxed community gathering has to respect the possibility of violence ruining the day.
Foreign players have thought twice before agreeing to play in Taiwan (at least one foreigner, a manager, was named in the scandal), and an Australian team declined to sign a Taiwanese pitcher who was linked to the scheme but not charged. (He played in the Dodgers farm system this year.) The country’s push to play host to a part of the World Baseball Classic, which is run by Major League Baseball, has slowed as well.
After Alex Teixeira’s move to Liverpool fell through, and the Brazilian was sold days later for $55 million to the Chinese Super League club Jiangsu Suning, the former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson said in a Liverpool newspaper that Teixeira “must have the professional ambition of a gnat.”
Travel in Brazil is never entirely without risk, of course, but games are much safer than they used to be. Armed with some advance knowledge, common-sense precautions and a sense of adventure, it’s far more exciting to sit in the general-admission grandstand. In summary: arrive very early, don’t bring valuables, and sit on the edges of the grandstand, not in the middle of the mayhem.
Even teams in small markets cost hundreds of millions of dollars these days. Unless you’re Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft chief who spent $2 billion on the Los Angeles Clippers without the help of outside investors, most potential owners don’t have the wherewithal, or the gumption, to finance a purchase themselves. But rather than money without strings attached ― investors who would have little involvement beyond writing checks ― Lacob and Guber purposefully sought out entrepreneurs and businessmen with attributes and access that complemented their own. “Everyone he’s partnered with has a strategic reason to be there,” says Dennis Mannion, C.E.O. of the Detroit Pistons, who has held executive positions with teams in all four major American sports leagues. “You have this phenomenal bullpen of talent.”
Following breaking world record of 200-meter breaststroke in 2002 Busan Asian games, Kosuke Kitajima wined two gold medals while creating new world records of 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke in 2003 world championships. Constructing a yellow empire in the world of highly white man, he deserves true king of breaststroke.
In June, S.I.P.G. paid about $60 million to add the Brazilian striker Hulk from the Russian club Zenit St. Petersburg. In January, the barrel-chested Hulk was joined by his far more silky compatriot Oscar, who cost a similar amount when he was lured from the English powerhouse Chelsea.
Then the Flamengo samba machine swung back into action. The fans started singing again, a love song to their team. Their banners waved like mainsails in a storm. Mourning would wait for later: Flamengo eventually lost 1-0. But in Brazil, telling fans to stop cheering because the opposing team scored would be like telling a D.J. to stop the party because someone danced badly.
Before the arrest in 2009 of the Windshield Wiper, whose real name is Tsai Cheng-yi, the Taiwanese league endured several other game-fixing scandals, remarkable in a league that was founded only in 1989 and has had as few as four teams. Players were kidnapped and pistol-whipped, and their families were threatened. One coach was stabbed. Gangsters were arrested and players banished. Attendance dipped, too, but within a year or two, many fans returned.
Brazil should get its goals against Croatia. The challenge will be controlling Modric, a deceptive midfielder who is the hub of Croatia's attack. Modric isn't flashy, and his exploits don't show up in the obvious places of a standard game report. He didn't score or register an assist during qualifying, but he led the team in nearly every passing category.
Likewise, when the Colombian Jackson Martínez left Atlético Madrid after barely half a season, the presumption was that he couldn’t cut it in Madrid. Ramires, the Brazilian sold by Chelsea, and Gervinho, the Ivory Coast striker sold by Roma, are other notable players who have joined Chinese clubs in recent weeks in what The Sun newspaper has called the “Great Haul of China.”
The style depends on the ability of Neymar to control and guide the offense in the middle of the field, drawing defenders and creating opportunities for striker Frederico Guedes, who in the classic tradition of the best Brazilians goes by the single name Fred. Fred had five goals in as many games in the Confederations Cup and has been part of a wave of top Brazilians who have decided to ply their trade at home in recent years instead of in Europe.
But none of those should dissuade you from experiencing soccer in Brazil. The phrase “the beautiful game” did not originate in the country, but it accurately describes the fluid and frequently dazzling play you’ll see. After attending six games last fall, I concluded that Brazilians speak soccer fluently, while everyone else has an accent.
as tseng wen - cheng stresses , " whether management or players , everyone in pro baseball should ask themselves this : when people can just turn on the tv and watch top - shelf games from the us or japan , how can we persuade fans to identify with and support taiwanese professional baseball ? "

MOON Jae-in, President of the Republic of Korea said, “For the government, this will be the first major international event since we took office. I believe the government has an obligation to make the Games a success. Up until now, the government left this job to the Organizing Committee and Gangwon Province. Now with 200 days left, the central government will join forces to make the PyeongChang Olympic Winter Games a complete success. This is a chance for the people of our nation to heal and regain hope by successfully hosting the Olympic Winter Games.”
She said, “Korea is where my sporting career began, so I am very excited to be supporting the Olympic and Paralympic Games in PyeongChang and to have the chance to witness other Korean athletes performing in front of home fans. “I have been fortunate enough to build an incredible career in Japan and I’m thrilled to be representing PyeongChang 2018 not only in Korea but also throughout the world. “I hope that fans from all sports will become excited about the Winter Games and get behind athletes to give them lots of support.”
“To play in Japan made me feel prouder and fonder of Korea. In particular, I have high hopes for PyeongChang 2018 as it is the first Olympic Games held in Korea in 30 years. I will do whatever I can to draw more interest in the Games.”
During the establishment of its office, the POCOG carefully reviewed information related to the relocations of the Sochi Organizing Committee for the 2014 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games and the Yeosu Expo Organizing Committee. By doing so, it minimized the risks inherent in such movement of personnel and facilities.
I will always remember the moment when I presented the first olympic gold medal at the los angeles games in 1984, because it was awarded to a chinese athlete, xu haifeng and it was also the first olympic gold medal to be won by a chinese person in the olympic history.

“There are quite a few out gay athletes competing. You used to never hear about that or see that. There were gay people competing, but they weren’t out or written about. Slowly, there’s starting to be a realization that gays are interested in sports, that they’re actually good at sports, and they can excel and achieve like anyone else.”
Aidan Reynolds, 18, was put forward by Lynn Davies, who captained Team GB at Moscow 1980 and Los Angeles 1984. Aidan gave up a promising basketball career to focus on the javelin, winning three medals at national level at the English Schools, UK School Games and English Championships.
So yes, the city has a massive crime problem and the whole affair was just a horrible idea to begin with, but now athletes don’t even have the luxury of catching Pikachus in their downtime (if they can find a Pikachu anyway). This successful augmented reality app has been released in at least 28 countries so far, but not in Brazil. Thanks for that.
Tom Daley and his washboard abs are part of Great Britain's diving team. This is his third Olympics! In 2012, he won the bronze medal, but the 22-year-old is hoping for the gold this time around.

LOS ANGELES — Dozens of Russian athletes at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, including at least 15 medal winners, were part of a state-run doping program, meticulously planned for years to ensure dominance at the games, according to the director of the country’s antidoping laboratory at the time.
Budapest, Hungary, has lost five bids to host the Games in its history, and it appears to be lagging behind the other three cities with greater Olympic resumes. Paris would be looking to host for the first time since 1924, Rome since 1960 and Los Angeles since 1984.
Guided by former star spiker, the ’Iron Hammer’ Lang Ping, the Chinese overcame a second-set scare to defeat Japan 3-1 on the final day of the World Cup in Nagoya to finish top of the 12-team tournament and clinch a direct berth to the 2016 Games.
Grigory Rodchenkov, Russia’s former anti-doping lab director, told The New York Times in May that he covered up the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Russian Olympians at the 2014 Sochi Games, and that he did so under orders from Russian officials for the ministry of sport.
Her success was one of the stand-out stories of the day at the Olympic Stadium where, earlier in the day, Brazil’s teenage sensation Petrucio Ferreira dos Santos had got the home crowd roaring as he smashed the world record to take gold in the men’s 100m T47
A more sombre political note is sounded by the Folha de S. Paulo website, which notes that the ceremony engaged with social causes and was an uncomfortable experience for Brazil’s interim president, Michel Temer, who was booed by some in the crowd as he declared the Games open.
Travis: Well, I think it was the last winter Olympics, where, I don't know which channel in the Unites States was covering it but whatever channel was covering it most of the olympics was just people's background and personal stories and profiles and a lot of America got really fed up with it, and I don't know if you were still here in Japan or if you were in the Unites States at the time of the last olympics, but people didn't watch the last olympics in the states.
The country came in second place in the medal rankings in 2004 and 2012, and even top in 2008, so this year’s haul has upset the sports authorities.

'There are a couple of bizarre things that happen,' Schmidt, 47, told an audience in New York last month.'One of the things you get when you win a Nobel Prize is, well, a Nobel Prize.

Images of this hyper-sexualised, commodified male are everywhere, from  Hollywood films to glossy magazines and billboard advertising. British journalist Mark Simpson calls them ‘spornosexuals,’ men who want to look like sportsmen or porn stars, chiselling their physiques through a cocktail of gym sessions, diets and drugs.

xinhua news agency , brasilia on january 14 , sports special ( reporter chen weihua , zhao yan ) world beach soccer champion team brazil beat world star league , which was composed of multi - country players , 7 - 6 on the 14 th in sao paulo , setting a new record of 44 consecutive wins .
The list of Olympic participants targeted by Brazilian boos is long and varied: Russians, due to its doping scandal; Spaniards, as symbols of Latin American colonialism; a tennis ball boy who had butterfingers; favorites—like the poor Romanian women’s handball team—when they played the underdogs; and, of course, anyone from Brazil’s historic rival Argentina, who probably get the worst of it.
Grigory Rodchenkov, Russia’s former anti-doping lab director, told The New York Times in May that he covered up the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Russian Olympians at the 2014 Sochi Games, and that he did so under orders from Russian officials for the ministry of sport.

Guangzhou Evergrande has won two of the past three Asian Champions League titles, and there is a rising number of famous coaches in the league, such as Luiz Felipe Scolari, the 2002 World Cup winner with Brazil, and Sven-Goran Eriksson, the former head coach of England’s national team.

This isn’t to say that owners have no impact. They choose how to spend their money ― and how much of it to spend. They determine the goals of a franchise and how it will go about attaining them. But their attempts to directly influence the sports side of their operations have usually ended badly. “These people have been wildly successful in all their endeavors,” says Jerry West, the N.B.A. Hall of Famer who spent 20 years as the general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers. “But being involved in a sports team is so much different than anything they’ve done in their lives.”

So why not take advantage of it?' said Patricia Casaes, a 36-year-old stay-at-home mom who was buying the Brazilian jersey for her family at a bustling street fair in downtown Sao Paulo. 'Starting Thursday, everyone here is going to get very excited and they will forget about the problems and the protests. Everyone will be in the World Cup mood.'
By analysing the status guo of the individual dribble一offerce ability in the Brazilian and Italian football teams during the final of the 15th World—cup Game，the author tries to reveal the guantity and guality of this tactics applied in different match-areas so as to provide a reference for the training avrangement and the competition tactics of football teams at all levels．
For his costly 2013 effort, Mr. Blumencranz dutifully did all his training leading up to Kona, the pinnacle of swim-run-bike sport ― a one-day 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and 26.2-mile marathon through the island’s torrid, wind-swept lava fields. Qualifying was difficult: Although he had twice completed the Ironman distance race in Lake Placid, N.Y., Mr. Blumencranz is not an elite athlete.
But instead of coming together to extol such triumphs on the global stage as the host of the World Cup, the soccer tournament starting on Thursday with teams from 32 countries, a grim mood is dividing many Brazilians as resentment simmers over the ballooning costs of the mega-event and a sluggish post-boom economy saps optimism.
The reasons officials and coaches cite for the decline are varied. For starters, other Asian countries have caught up in terms of resources put into women’s soccer. Japan is the reigning World Cup champion. Australia, which plays in the Asian region, is ranked ahead of China, and so is North Korea, though it was barred from this year’s Cup because of a doping scandal.
You also won’t run out of soccer-related things to do between games. In Rio, there’s the small museum at Maracanã, Brazil’s most famous soccer stadium. (The museum remains open during pre-Cup stadium renovations.) Elsewhere, the city’s beaches host informal games, known as peladas. One of the more regular and impressive ones is the Pelada de Siqueira Campos, on Copacabana beach just off the street of the same name, on Sundays at 10:30 a.m. It’s serious business, and looks utterly exhausting. And on both Copacabana and Ipanema beaches, you’ll find lots of impressive futevolei, a version of volleyball played soccer style, with no hand or arm contact.
‘‘If Guangzhou can keep going like this, it will be at the top of Asian soccer for years, and who knows what it can achieve?’’ Damjanovic said. ‘‘It is good for Asia. Guangzhou is pushing China, Korea and Japan and all of the continent to play better.’’
A victory over the United States would allow China to reassert its primacy in women’s soccer in Asia. Japan is the reigning World Cup champion. Australia, which plays in the Asian confederation, is ranked ahead of China. So is North Korea, though it was barred from this World Cup because of a doping scandal.
For years, fans in China have watched South Korea and Japan succeed at both the club and national levels. The two neighbors to the east send an increasing number of young players to the big European leagues, reach the knockout stages at World Cups and fight for medals at the Olympics.
If you read Jackson this way, as most people do, you will have an intermittently good time, and you will come away with a handful of memorable tidbits. You will learn, for instance, that Jerry Buss, the former Los Angeles Lakers owner who died in 2013 (and the father of Jackson’s fiancée), had a “penchant for hanging out with young girls and dancing till 3 in the morning.” You will learn that in Game 6 of the 1997 N.B.A. finals, the Chicago Bulls’ equipment manager accidentally gave the players GatorLode, a high-carbohydrate drink, rather than Gatorade, meaning that each player “ingested the equivalent of about 20 baked potatoes.”
Its investments quickly paid off: Guangzhou has won five straight Chinese Super League titles, and it now averages crowds of nearly 46,000 a game. Last summer, the team hired Brazil’s former World Cup manager, Luiz Felipe Scolari; he quickly delivered Guangzhou’s second Asian Champions League title in three years.
Jean-François Martins, the city’s deputy mayor in charge of sports, has said it is all part of a plan to make the city’s swimming pools more “eco-responsible” in preparation for the 2024 Olympic Games, which Paris is in the running to host. (Los Angeles and Budapest are the other contenders.)
South Africans showed in 2010, and are showing again now by remaining glued to our screens in wonderment, that we are willing to hold whatever discontent we may feel about FIFA and the World Cup’s legacy in abeyance for the love of the game and for national pride. One can only hope that ― win or lose ― the Brazilians will be tougher and demand more of their leaders.
“At that time, many people opposed to the government initially questioned whether we would be strengthening the dictatorship by rooting for Brazil’s team,” said Ms. Rousseff, 66. “I had no such dilemma,” she added, saying that even within the walls of her prison in São Paulo, such resistance dissipated in the run-up to Brazil’s victory over Italy in the championship match, which took place in Mexico City.
At the 1978 World Cup, fear of failure loomed large over Argentina’s match with Brazil. Predictably, the match, a 0-0 tie that would become known as the Batalha de Rosário, was as ill-tempered as any of their encounters. By 1995, the Argentines, who had conveniently chosen to forget Diego Maradona’s sleight of hand against England in Mexico nine years before, were appalled by the Brazilian Túlio using his to help himself score. Robbery and outrage were the twin accusations from the Argentine federation.
In 2010, Mr. Marbury, who had played for the Minnesota Timberwolves, New Jersey Nets, Phoenix Suns, New York Knicks and Boston Celtics, wrapped up his N.B.A. years and went to China to start anew. After playing briefly with the Shanxi Zhongyu Brave Dragons and the Foshan Dralions, he joined the Beijing Ducks in 2011. In the four years since, he has led the team to three national championships.
PARIS ― Money talks in global soccer, as it does everywhere else, perhaps more so. The sport is big business. The likes of Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar are international brands, as recognizable as any Hollywood star. Compare a club’s wage bill to its success rate: the correlation is overwhelming. When billionaires acquire clubs like Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City or Chelsea, their fortunes change. When a very rich country like Qatar wants to host the World Cup, it gets its way even if entirely unsuited to the undertaking.
Countries across Asia and Oceania, including some that have never seen snow, will compete at the Sochi Olympics. South Korea, Japan and China are sending some of the biggest teams and will be legitimate contenders to win many medals, particularly in skating, ski jumping and freestyle skiing. At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, South Korea finished seventh in overall medals, while China placed eighth and Japan finished a disappointing 16th. Here's a look at these countries' top athletes in Sochi, as well as some interesting characters from smaller countries, including a skier from East Timor and a luger from Tonga.
For a team that did not exist until a dozen years ago, the ability to attract more than 28,000 fans on a cold Tuesday evening in a city that offers plenty of entertainment alternatives was encouraging ― for the team, for Shanghai and for Chinese soccer in general.
According to the matches between Chinese team and Brazilian team,Chinese team and USA team in Women World Cup 2003,the correlative data which indicates the net strength are collected,and are also compared and analyzed. In order to search the gap,we will use some references which enables us to understand the development law of the present world women volleyball sports more deeply,to further improve the scientific training level.
Here’s when you probably won’t find it: during the World Cup, which Brazil will host from June 12 to July 13, 2014. It won’t be in the stands when, say, Cameroon plays Serbia, or when France squares off against the Uzbeks. The World Cup will be a good party, guaranteed ― and the handful of games the Brazilian side plays will be all-out spectacles. (Good luck getting tickets for those matches.) But the best time to experience true Brazilian soccer ― or, more accurately, futebol (foo-tchee-BOW) ― will be outside the parameters of the Cup.
The long-term goals include hosting a World Cup and elevating the men’s team to the top ranks of international competition. The event has been held in Asia only once, when it was played in South Korea and Japan in 2002. Qatar will host the competition in 2022.
At the last sporting event in the South involving North Korea, the East Asian Cup of soccer last summer, the North Korean women's team got little support, barring a handful of ethnic North Koreans who traveled from Japan and looked bored through most of the games. Some pro-unification groups did show up to cheer both sides, but perhaps Pyongyang has decided it needed to make sure its athletes at the Asian Games wouldn't be ignored.
As yet, Chinese teams have been less interested in Japanese players. “Japan’s attacking players are better than their defenders, but Chinese clubs buy attacking players from South America or Africa.” explained Luo. “Korean defenders are more suitable for Chinese teams.” Luo also pointed out that political relations between the China and Japan make it more difficult.
From the laid-back beaches of Rio de Janeiro, which hosts the Cup final, to the button-down streets of Sao Paulo, which hosts the opening match, this soccer-mad country is surprisingly subdued on the eve of hosting the world's largest sporting event, one that Brazil has won a record five times.
'We really haven't taken as much money for Brazil at this stage in the tournament as we might have expected,' says Alex Donohue, a spokesman for London-based bookie Ladbrokes. He said the early ouster of both England and defending World Cup champions Spain have helped the odds of most other teams that advanced beyond the tournament's group stage.
The glum mood reflects the mixed feelings that many Brazilians have about this tournament and the state of their country. Brazil is still soccer-mad, but they are also mad -- as in angry -- at how their own government and FIFA, soccer's global governing body, organized these games, with billions of dollars having been spent on state-of-the-art stadiums in a developing country where health care and education lag. The total bill is $11.5 billion and counting.
Chinese clubs might not release players for national team play except in the mandatory official windows, Edu said, before adding: “It’s a personal decision, but you need to balance it. And if you’re good enough and have the chance to play for Brazil, nothing should get in the way.”
“He’s kind of got it all: He’s good-looking, he’s a superstar, and Brazil is a major force in the World Cup regardless of what country that’s hosting it,” said Will Welch, the style editor at GQ. “Add in the fact that Brazil is hosting the cup, and that’s just ramping it up even further.”
With the development of afforestation construction of the city in recent years, especially since Beijing's application for organizing the Olympic Games and Shanghai's application for organizing the World's Fair success, garden nursery trade of China develop very swift and violent, nursery stock market present the supply exceeds demand situation in some district, the competition is very fierce.
Yuzuru Hanyu is a figure skater from Sendai, which was devastated by the tsunami that followed the 2011 earthquake. Hanyu was reportedly training when the earthquake struck, and he ran from the rink in Miyagi without removing his skates. In April 2012, he moved to Toronto to be coached by Brian Orser. Hanyu, 19 years old, is in good form coming into Sochi, having won the Grand Prix finals in Fukuoka last month, as well as topping 100 points in the Japan nationals. Another medal hope in men's figure skating is Daisuke Takahashi, who won bronze at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.
I had taken up Ping-Pong during college, and in my 30s dove in more deeply, climbing the long stairway up to a table tennis center in Westfield, N.J., where I watched Olympic hopefuls and took lessons. Arthroscopy for torn knee cartilage soon sidelined me. Shortly afterward, a distracted driver made an illegal turn at a pedestrian crossing and drove directly into my bum knee.
But winning Group A is crucial if the Selecao wants to avoid a likely round-of-16 showdown with defending champion Spain, which is the favorite in Group B. To do that, the Brazilians will likely stick to the high-tempo, high-pressure style they displayed in winning the 2013 Confederations Cup. It is the style they played in 2002, when their current coach, Luiz Felipe Scolari guided the team to its unprecedented fifth championship.
The monthlong, 32-country soccer tournament known as the World Cup kicks off on June 12 in Brazil. And guess where the most tickets have been sold, outside of Brazil that is? Defying all logic, it’s the United States, the only country in the world you have to start an article about the World Cup by explaining what it is, when it starts and where it’s being played.
He was a baseball fan, though, and he liked to hang around ballparks, where he sat near the dugout and chatted up players, some of whom joined him for dinner. He also befriended former players living in southern Taiwan, whom he paid to recruit active players.
When Brazil won the right to host the Cup in 2007, everyone imagined that the atmosphere would be incredible in the country that produced Pele and legions of other soccer greats. But much has changed here. A year ago, roughly a million Brazilians took to the streets to rail against the country's poor public services even as the tab for the Cup grew. Mass protests have since died off, but pockets of hard-core Black Bloc protesters still take to the streets. And scores of recent strikes have added to the tension, including a subway strike in Sao Paulo that threatens to snarl traffic on game days.
The biggest question for the Brazilians may be their style. Will they live up to their reputation for playing the world's most beautiful soccer, or take it easy on the acrobatics, play more defensively, and prioritize winning a sixth world championship? Scolari has made his priorities clear. The only beautiful soccer, he has been saying lately, is winning soccer.
Uruguay may have been the catalyst that turned Brazil into the world’s most successful national team, but Brazil’s greatest rivalry remains with Argentina. The two nations have history. The rivalry became so problematic that between 1946 and 1956, the countries did not play each other in a competitive match. When Brazil defeated Argentina by a goal at the 1956 South American championship, it was the first time it had beaten its rival in formal competition since 1922. There was no love lost between the countries, either.
While some wonder why European teams are not racing to match China’s spending in the market, the simple answer seems to be that they do not value the players as highly. Thus, in Brazil, where once there was pride in selling brilliant artists to those who appreciated them, now there is little joy in selling off lesser players at inflated prices.
Of course, there are some who believe the four World Cup games set for Manaus should not be played here anyway. Critics of the stadium in Manaus, as well as similar projects in Brasilia and in Cuiaba, note the lack of top-division soccer teams in those cities and call the expensive stadiums white elephants.
The writer is Phil Jackson, newly ordained savior of the Knicks and author of a nearly Mailer-like profusion of books. Getting through the 1,682 pages of his collected works requires every trick in his oeuvre: every breathing technique, every Lao Tzu quotation, every positive visualization. As in meditation, the rewards are considerable, but so is the suffering.
ECG of part of the athletes from Chinese delegation to participate the 12thAsian Games held in Hiroshima 1994 were analyzed with comparison between ages, sex-es, different sports events and with non-athletes. It was discovered that: 1. the abnormalrate of ECG of athletes (83.51%) was higher than that of non-athletes (66.75%);
The Chinese Super Cup was secured on Feb. 24, with a victory over last season’s league runner-up, Jiangsu Suning. Based in Nanjing, Jiangsu was bolstered by signing the Brazilian stars Alex Teixeira and Ramires, for a combined total of about $80 million in 2016, and is expected to challenge again.
The Team Most Commonly Seen in Anguish: Brazil. There were 17 incidents in two games when a member of the Selecao was seen on the ground in pain -- the most of any country. World Cup poster boy Neymar had five such 'injuries,' the most on his team. In every case he was back on his feet within 15 seconds.
“Brazil is struggling as a country,” said Ricardo Mello, who works as an intermediary between Brazilian players and Chinese clubs. As the Brazilian real has plummeted in value, he said, the ability to be paid in foreign currency “means a lot to players; it can change lives forever.”
While thousands poured into the streets in 2007 to celebrate Brazil’s winning bid to host the World Cup, bitter strikes are now roiling major cities. In São Paulo, where the opening match between Brazil and Croatia is just days away, riot police on Monday used tear gas to disperse striking subway workers. Brazilian legends of the sport, from Ronaldo to Romário, are voicing shame and disgust over troubled preparations in the nation which has won the World Cup five times, more than any other.
Based on the statistics, analysis, and comparison of the foul situations by the eight  final jumpers of men's triple jump at the Third World Field and Track Championships held in Tokyo, Japan, 1991, it is found that the success rate of the first three trial jumps is higher than that of the final three trial jumps. From the psychological point of views this Phenomenon has been analysed and the  conclusion is reached that it is necessary to strengthen the psychological training of triple jumpers.
According to FIFA, soccer’s governing body, in 2006 China accounted for the largest single-country audience, with 3.98 billion viewers throughout the games, or 15 percent of the total cumulative television audience. Even more viewers watched the 2010 World Cup, with an average of 17.5 million Chinese watching each live match ― even in the middle of the night. This was far ahead of the 4.1 million viewers from the host country, South Africa, the 16.1 million from Brazil and the 8.8 million from Germany.
More than 200 million people live in Brazil, Latin America’s largest democracy, and the country has about as many opinions on hosting the World Cup. President Dilma Rousseff, in an interview last week in Brasília, defended loans from state banks for building lavish World Cup stadiums, and said Brazilians were gearing up to embrace the tournament.
The last time Brazil hosted the World Cup, in 1950, the country's glorious soccer history hadn't been written yet. The five championships all came later. So did the famous yellow-and-green jerseys. So did Pelé. But the 1950 tournament was supposed to be the first chapter, written during the final game, inside the Maracanã, the 200,000-seat arena in Rio de Janeiro purpose-built for the World Cup. Instead, it turned into the team's darkest day.
More than half the surface of Brazil is covered by rain forest. So it's only fitting that the World Cup should have a stadium smack in the middle of it, right? Meet the 42,000-seat Arena da Amazônia in Manaus, perhaps the most confusing stadium at the tournament.
Because of the World Cup's format in those days, technically there wasn't a final, just a final game at the end of a second group stage. It meant that Brazil, having steamrolled through opponents, needed only a draw against Uruguay to lift the trophy for the first time. Uruguay needed to win outright.
For Brazil, that means only one thing: seven victories that culminate in a championship in Rio in July 13. Just three host nations have won the tournament over the past 40 years: West Germany in 1974, Argentina in 1978 and France in 1998. During that time, an impressive list of hosts have come up short, including Spain, Mexico, Italy and Germany in 2006.
When Brazil was chosen to host both the World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, the news was seen as confirmation of the country’s status as a developing world power. But spending on the stadiums has drawn the ire of street protesters and prosecutors questioning priorities in a nation where public schools and hospitals remain in lamentable conditions.
But last year the Brasileirão’s two best players ― both of them having broken into the national team ― made the switch. One, Diego Tardelli, had just won the Brazilian Cup with Atlético Mineiro. The other, Ricardo Goulart, had just won back-to back league championships with Cruzeiro. And the money is only getting better: The onetime Sevilla striker Luís Fabiano left São Paulo for China last month for a salary reported at $7 million a year.
Brazil, whose postwar history is measured in five World Cup titles, has no choice but to win the tournament. Expectations for Brazil are high not only within the country ― despite endless news reports of civil unrest and an inability to complete stadiums on time ― but also outside the country. Brazil remains everyone’s favorite. It has become synonymous with the game.
Revenge, apparently, motivated the WADA hacks. In May, The New York Times reported the account of Russia’s longtime anti-doping lab chief, who said the country had run a doping program and staged an elaborate cheating scheme at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. A subsequent report commissioned by WADA confirmed that account.
Rodchenkov told The New York Times that Russian athletes had doped leading up to the 2008 Beijing Games, the 2012 London Games and throughout the course of the 2014 Sochi Games, when Russia controlled the Olympic testing laboratory. He described an overnight operation in which he and a small team had substituted Russian athletes’ tainted urine for clean urine, stockpiled in the months leading up to competition and passed surreptitiously through a hole in the wall of the lab building.
Through making comparison on statistical data,this paper analyzes the ability of active score of top 4 teams,Brazil,Italy,China and Cuba in 2005 World Woman Volleyball Grand Prix finals. The result shows that the ability of active score of four teams can not become the decisive factors of their final result. The rule of wining competition depends on conditioning and mental state at competition.
Ni was a 7-year-old schoolgirl in Shanghai when she first fell in love with the game. Last week, at the age of 53, she competed in her third Olympics, wearing for a third time the uniform of Luxembourg, the nation she adopted as her home in 1991. In a sport that rewards the skill of subtle anticipation, her unconventional move 25 years ago has proved prescient.
The place was built for a coronation, a colossal theater where hundreds of thousands could bear witness and celebrate. When Maracanã opened in 1950, in the heart of Rio, it was the world’s largest stadium, the site of what Brazil was certain would be its first World Cup championship. And things started well enough: The host country breezed through to the final match, where, because of tournament rules at the time, it needed only a draw against Uruguay to win the whole event. With little more than 10 minutes to go, the score was 1-1, and the fans were on edge. Then the Uruguayan winger Alcides Ghiggia put them over with a sudden strike. “Only three people have, with just one motion, silenced the Maracanã,” he famously said later. “Frank Sinatra, Pope John Paul II and me.”
Cameroon took the initiative even before the team boarded its plane for Brazil, with the players demanding their appearance fee for the World Cup up front, in cash. Or else, they said, they would not go. Last week the players from Ghana refused to practice and threatened a player strike in their game against Portugal unless they quickly received more than $3 million, cash in hand.
This article, through the video statistics on the techniques and tactics of 5 matches of China against Qatar, Korea, Kuwait, Japan and Bahrain, thinks that while persisting in long pass and high attack, the Chinese team should put the stress on improving the ability of pass-and-cut combinations and breakthrough with ball handling.
Of the 736 players headed to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, just 236 of them have been called up to the global soccer tournament before, according to FIFA.com. Spain has the largest number of veterans on its squad with 16, who are seeking to repeat their 2010 World Cup win. Uruguay and Cameroon follow, with 15 and 13 veterans each, respectively.
“Suddenly, everyone buys top foreigners,” said Mads Davidsen, a Danish assistant coach at Shanghai SIPG who has been in China since 2013. “When I came here, the foreigners on C.S.L. teams didn’t have that good a level. Now it’s extremely difficult to come here as a foreigner. You have to have a high level. All of this has helped lift the league.”
The N.B.A.’s response to Mr. Sterling’s comments may put an end to one of the more criticized ownership tenures in American sports. Mr. Sterling bought the San Diego Clippers in 1981 and moved them to Los Angeles in 1984, deep in the shadow of the popular and successful Lakers. The Clippers spent decades as a consistent joke, with Mr. Sterling the easy punch line. The team managed just one winning season in Mr. Sterling’s first 24 years as owner, and still has never made it past the second round of the playoffs.
That said, it is not simple to plan a soccer trip to Brazil. I had an advantage as a Portuguese speaker who had lived in the country for two years. Others might find it more difficult. The complex league schedules are largely unavailable in English. You’ll have to find your way to the stadium, choosing between public transportation and sometimes pricey taxis. Even where to sit can be a consequential decision.
Evergrande was again the biggest spender, paying a C.S.L.-record $16.2 million for the Brazilian Ricardo Goulart, but other clubs also made flashy deals, most notably Shanghai SIPG, which signed Conca for a reported $10.8 million per year and hired the former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson as coach.
The stadium in Santos is tiny and intimate, so the seats are very close to the action. (Cubs and Red Sox fans will recognize the appeal.) And pretty soon, Santos will be home to a brand-new museum dedicated to Pelé, in a renovated mansion known as the Casarão do Valongo. It’s scheduled to be open by the World Cup. But no need to rush ― it will still be there when the World Cup ends and real Brazilian soccer starts up again.
“That’s a big concern for parents,” Sun said in a telephone interview from Shanghai, where she leads the technical and youth departments of the city’s soccer association. “If you have four or five children, maybe you say, ‘O.K., I support one to be a great athlete.’ But with only one child, that is a problem.”
Most of the national soccer teams have arrived. Gaggles of journalists from Russia to Japan prowl the cities. Brazilian workers are hastily putting the finishing touches on the stadiums. But just two days before the World Cup opens here on Thursday, one crucial thing was still missing: atmosphere.
In this article, the author makes statistical analysis on three matches (China V S Cuba, Russia VS Brazil) at the 1999 world cup and the 27th Olympic Games, anal yzes the distribution of setters in the four teams, points out the relation betw een the setter and attack tactics of whole team and put forwards the importance of overall cultivating setters.
Funk’s varied repertory provides an apt soundtrack for the changes sweeping across the city after the recent boom that lifted incomes and ushered in the era of megaevents like this month’s World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics, while also accentuating longstanding inequality. Samba, forbidden by the authorities about a century ago in much the same way that varieties of funk are prohibited today, has developed into such an establishment fixture that big corporations now underwrite carnival compositions. Bossa nova, the breezy fusion of samba and jazz, seems just too genteel for these times. But funk ― often aggressive, sensual, vulgar, narcissistic, anti-establishment and eminently adaptable to Brazil’s shifting political mood ― is thriving.
Chinese clubs can sign a maximum of five foreign players, though one must be Asian. In 2015, of the 15 out of 16 teams that filled their so-called “Asian quota,” eight had South Korean players. Guangzhou has the center back Kim Young-gwon, Shanghai S.I.P.G. signed another central defender in Kim Ju-young and Beijing Guoan has midfielder Ha Dae-sung.
As an alternate in the pool of 33 World Cup referees in Brazil this month, Hauata is a pulled hamstring away from the biggest stage in the game. And it isn't just the alternates who lack experience. Among the 24 official referees are several who have never called games involving big-name teams and players.
Mao Asada is a highly rated figure skater whose main rival for gold in Sochi is South Korea's Olympic champion Kim Yuna. Asada lost out to Kim in Vancouver, picking up a silver medal in the 2010 Games. Like her South Korean rival, Asada says she will retire after Sochi. The 23-year-old is famous for her triple axels, though some observers say she should give up the move given how difficult it is to produce a clean landing. Even Asada's dog is well-known in Japan; it appeared in a commercial for chocolate. Japan's other medal hopes in women's figure skating include Akiko Suzuki and Kanako Murakami.
Minutes later, Uruguay was the world champion. Barbosa was the scapegoat. Brazil did everything it could to erase the memory of that day--the disastrous Maracanazo, as they called it. They even abandoned their white jerseys. When Brazil finally claimed its birthright eight years later at the 1958 World Cup, led by a 17-year-old Pelé, the team wore blue. And on all four occasions they've won soccer's greatest prize since then, the Brazilians did it, unmistakably, in yellow.
When you think Brazil and you think soccer, you naturally think three-banded armadillos, right? Meet Fuleco the three-banded armadillo and 2014 World Cup mascot. He has the unique ability to roll himself up into a soccer ball and fits squarely in the tournament's tradition of cartoon animals--like South Africa's Zakumi, the leopard with unnatural green hair from 2010; Footix, the blue cockerel from France 1998; or Goleo, the pantsless lion from Germany 2006.
Wearing white shirts and white shorts with blue trim, Brazil opened the scoring in the 47th minute through the winger Friaça. The party lasted just 19 minutes. Uruguay's Alcides Ghiggia set up Juan Schiaffino for the tying goal. At 1-1, Brazil was still on track to win the World Cup. Ghiggia had other ideas. In the 79th minute, he blazed down the right wing, cut inside and shaped to cross the ball before a split-second change of heart. Instead, he drilled a low shot to the near post, the spot a goalkeeper should always have covered.
Ironman distance triathlons are not the only events that attract Type A endurance athletes. In the last five years, Jeff Adams, 56, a retired Morgan Stanley executive living in Elkhorn, Wis., has run in 20 marathons around the world, including New York, Boston, London, Tokyo and even Antarctica.
Enow Ngachu, the coach of Cameroon, which lost by 1-0 to China in the round of 16, said he believed that China had a chance to defeat the Americans. China and the United States have not met in the World Cup since 1999, but they nonetheless play regularly and are familiar with each other. In their most recent meeting, they tied, 1-1, in December at a tournament in Brazil.
The tournament has proved to be a happy refuge for Brazilians who, just a few weeks ago, were so displeased with their country's direction that they told pollsters it was a bad idea to host the competition. As has happened countless times in dozens of countries, common support for a soccer team has drawn a nation's attention away from a toxic political environment and a damaged economy.
His club’s city rival, Shanghai Shenhua, could also challenge for silverware. The Blues finished fourth in 2016, a place below S.I.P.G., and bolstered their roster by bringing in the Argentine Carlos Tevez in January, reportedly making him the highest-paid player in the world at around $800,000 a week.
All 7 international master swimmers in Shanghai were genotype II. Genotype II and I allele frequency increased with the increasing of the athletic level. It is suggested that athletes with genotype II or I allele, especially genotype II, have the potential to achieve higher athletic level through training.
The process was costly and slow. Mr. Noor said it took him more than six months to get a container of imported furnishings through Brazil's customs. Finding reliable construction workers also was difficult, as Rio races to prepare for the World Cup as well as for the 2016 summer Olympics.
Fans like Mr. Triana Lozada are sleeping on buses, staying in hotels or on cruise ships, or simply bedding down in vehicles near Rio de Janeiro’s beaches. And the arrival in Brazil this year of more than 200,000 Spanish-speaking fans from large nations like Mexico and Colombia and smaller ones like Costa Rica and Uruguay exemplifies one of Latin America’s most profound shifts since the start of the century: the rise of the middle class.
The second notable figure is 618,725, which represents the Tweets per minute during the game, which came at the end of the match, when Germany became the world champion for the first time since 1990. That's a new record, Twitter says, surpassing the 580,166 Tweets per minute during Germany's 7-1 thrashing of hosts Brazil in the semifinals.
Mohammad Karim will ski for Pakistan at Sochi. 'Karim is a great athlete and we think he has very strong medal chances during the Olympics,' the Associated Press of Pakistan quoted Obaid-ur-Rehman Abbasi, the spokesman of Ski Federation of Pakistan, as saying. Pakistan made its Winter Olympics debut in Vancouver in 2010, where Muhammad Abbas finished 79th in the giant slalom. Abbas is traveling to Sochi as a reserve in case Karim gets injured, the Express Tribune reported.
The Jules Rimet trophy disappeared in Brazil in 1983 and is believed to have been melted down. To prevent that from happening again, today's winners spend little time with their prize. As the full-time property of FIFA, it's used for celebrations. But the actual hardware the winning teams take home is one of several gold-plated replicas, which are technically called the FIFA World Cup Winners' Trophies. Doesn't quite have the same ring to it.
Crime was already a top concern before the Rio Games began, as Brazil’s economic crisis deepened, pushing up unemployment and poverty rates. The Rio state government deployed a huge security force, and the streets surrounding the Olympic Park and the athletes’ village sometimes look like military compounds.
Now our soccer reform has passed a dozen years, coming football market, and the Chinese national team has been into the World Cup finals also, but in the World Cup there were larger gaps when we compared with Japan a year earlier in the professional league and South Korea of semi-professional league.
There have been 66 countries and regions that won 5336 medals at the weightlifting competitions of Olympic Games,senior world championships Junior world championships,Womenworld championships from 1891 to 1993.The former Soviet Union,Bulgarla,PR China,Potand,Hungary, former East German,United States of America,German,Japan and cuba hold the frontplaces in terms of the medal numbers that they won.
Still, ire over Brazil’s handling of the tournament remains widespread over the estimated $11 billion cost of hosting the tournament, including subsidized loans for stadiums in cities like Brasília the capital; Cuiabá, a remote agribusiness center; and Manaus, an industrial hub deep in the Amazon, with paltry soccer fan bases.
Santos is a storied club ― it has won eight national championships and was Pelé’s team from 1957 to 1974. On two World Cup teams, in 1962 and 1970, 8 of the 11 starting players played in Santos, and although that is unlikely ever to happen again (most top Brazilian players now make millions for European clubs), it is, at least for now, the squad of Neymar, the 21-year-old Instagram-using star who many consider the best player in the country.
Yet Chinese soccer’s taste for Brazilians shows no sign of slowing. Last week, Chelsea accepted a $35 million offer for the Brazilian midfielder Ramires from Jiangsu Suning, which had earlier made a failed bid for the Milan striker Luiz Adriano. Moves like those, and the bulk acquisitions of younger players from Brazilian clubs, have soccer officials here concerned about what the money-driven deals could one day mean for the future of Brazil’s national team. Ramires, 28, was a starter at the last World Cup, and while he had fallen out of favor recently, exports like Gil, 28, and Renato Augusto, 27, were thought by some to be part of the Seleção’s future after their recent resurgence at Corinthians.
For Brazil the journey starts with the team's most difficult challenge of the group stage. Croatia is tough and experienced and has one of the world's great midfielders in Luka Modric. Don't be fooled by the checkerboard red jerseys. Croatia -- 18th in the FIFA world ranking -- is the furthest thing from a cupcake.
Because of the time difference with Brazil, the host country, most of the live matches will be aired in the early morning hours in China. But if history is anything to go by, this will not slow fans down. The 2006 and 2010 World Cups drew millions of viewers in China, even though the Chinese team qualified for neither.
One more thing: Brazilian men are not particularly known for their shyness around women, and given the male-dominated crowds at most matches, women (and, for that matter, parents and their children) may feel more comfortable in a calmer area, away from the grandstand. And you may be glad that your children don’t understand Portuguese: chants directed at referees and opposing players can get vulgar and often homophobic.
Nightmare visions of an embarrassing loss followed the own goal, but Neymar, the silky attacker who is the darling of the Brazilian fans, rescued the mood with a brilliant goal 18 minutes later. The 22-year-old Neymar, who is playing in his first World Cup, dribbled to the top of the penalty area and rolled a shot in off the post that sent the Brazilian bench into hysterics as fireworks exploded outside the stadium.
In Los Angeles, West worked for Jerry Buss, arguably the most successful owner in modern sports history. Buss presided over a franchise that reached the N.B.A. finals 16 times in his 33 seasons. He also invented or perfected club seating, luxury boxes and the glitzy showmanship that now seems an integral part of sporting events. “Jerry Buss was an innovator who thought basketball should have the cachet of a Broadway show,” West told me. “The fun! The excitement! But what made that possible? It was winning the way we won. Magic Johnson played the game with a joy that everyone could see. And he played with maybe the greatest player ever in Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. And he had James Worthy. We had seven players you could put on an All-Star team. And Jerry Buss had nothing to do with that.”
This study mainly adopts statistics from methodology to analyze the rationality and maneuverability about the new contest rules through the on-the-spot statistics of the 2002 nationwide martial arts routine championship and the 2003 Shanghai martial arts title match, and then concludes the original data about the C team (judge the difficult action), in order to perfect the competitive martial arts' new rules.
Luiz Felipe Scolari, the Brazilian coach, has not shied from the expectations of a title, but he has also said that he will not be bothered by the typical Brazilian requirement of winning with style. Grinding performances are anathema for Brazilian fans, but Scolari, knowing the stakes, has said he is only interested in results.
RIO DE JANEIRO ― To fulfill his dream of watching Colombia play in the World Cup, Marco Triana Lozada, an engineer from Bogotá, cobbled together savings to travel to Brazil this month. But to avoid spending money on hotels, he and his friends have traversed the country at night on buses to watch Colombia play, even opting to stay in tents at campsites.
BRASÍLIA ― With Brazil’s government facing widespread discontent over its preparations for the World Cup, President Dilma Rousseff hit back at critics in an interview here on Tuesday, defending loans from state banks for costly new stadiums for the tournament and insisting that Brazilians planning to shun the event were a “small minority.”
So Alex Teixeira saw his teammates scatter to clubs that could afford to remove them from Donetsk. He saw negotiations between Liverpool and Shakhtar go to the brink, then collapse at the deadline for transfers in Europe. It was said that the Brazilian only had to wait until the transfer window, in July, and Liverpool would seal the deal.
Many well-groomed NBA players didn't pay attention to their hair or skin before going pro. The Clippers' Mr. Jordan only began getting regular manicures and pedicures when he joined the league five years ago. 'My mom told me to do it,' he says. 'She's like, 'Well, your feet are going to take care of you, so you need to take care of your feet.' '
The mood is likely to brighten once Brazil's Selecao takes the field on Thursday against Croatia. Many Brazilians say they will still put on a good party -- even if they are down on their country. And it is hard to imagine that watching giant screens along Rio's beaches won't be an exhilarating atmosphere for foreign visitors.
SÃO PAULO ― It was Dia dos Namorados here on Thursday, the Brazilian equivalent of Valentine’s Day. That meant there were chocolates and flowers and couples holding hands tucked in among a sea of yellow jerseys that stretched from the Itaquera neighborhood over to Jardins. From sunrise all the way until the shimmering moon peeked above the skyline, Brazilians showed their passion for each other, and for soccer, on the opening day of the World Cup.
And now the same thing is happening in Brazil. For their part, Brazilians have responded to FIFA’s poisoned chalice in a more organized fashion than South Africans ever managed before, during or after the event. After seeing how the FIFA World Cup sausage is made, you might think that the protests in Brazil would make uncomfortable viewing for us in South Africa, but you’d be wrong.
The average player age for the past three World Cups is 27 years and five months, but there are players at very different ends of the age spectrum headed to Brazil. Colombian goalkeeper Faryd Mondragon, who turns 43 later this month, marks the tournament's oldest player, and, if he plays, could become the oldest player to take the field in World Cup history. Cameroonian forward Fabrice Olinga is the youngest player to be called up for the games at 18 years, one month old, according to FIFA.
Pang Qing and Tong Jian prove that love is on the ice, as well as in the air. The couple, who won silver in Vancouver, got engaged in 2011 when Tong proposed during a live television show called 'Art on Ice.' 'Before the Vancouver Winter Games, claiming an Olympic medal was my dream. But now my dream is to have you with me forever,' Tong said during the show in Shanghai. Tong and Jian are fourth in the International Skating Union world rankings.
“With the crisis here, the prices they are offering, we can’t compete with that,” Edu said of the recent sales. “But in terms of a player’s career, they are going for money, not the status, and for me, that would have made me think twice as it could get in the way of playing for Brazil.”
Making a rare public reference to her imprisonment decades ago, when interrogators tortured her after her capture as part of an urban guerrilla group, Ms. Rousseff said that even then, during the World Cup of 1970, she and fellow prisoners opposed to the military dictatorship avidly followed the monthlong soccer tournament from prison and supported Brazil’s national team.
In the first twenty-year development of China's hospitality industry, there were mainly star hotels which focused on customers with high or middle level income. However, the population of tourists from home and abroad are keeping increasing, including the ordinary solaria employees and businessmen, with the access to WTO for China and the successful bid for 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, the World Exhibition in Shanghai, the Recreational Exhibition in Hangzhou as well as the coming of holiday economy.
Through using the method of video statistics, literature, observation and comparison, this paper made technical statistics and analysis on five matches in 2005 Woman Volleyball Grand Prix among China, Cuba and Italy teams, found out the advantage and disadvantage of each team and put forwarded the suggestions.
But love ― in any form ― is a complicated matter. While there were moments of heat and adoration, particularly when Neymar scored the first of his two goals with an inch-perfect shot that bounced in off the post, Brazil’s 3-1 victory over Croatia was hardly the perfect date. Inside and outside the Arena Corinthians, emotions were mixed even before a contentious referee’s decision in favor of the home team plunged the tournament deep into its first controversy.
Apart from reaching the final of the 2004 Asian Cup on home soil, China has never been that type of team. The national team has long been in the shadow of its regional rivals South Korea and Japan, which also has a plan to be world champion by 2050.
Less than 24 hours after the conclusion of the 2014 World Cup final, most of the world's soccer fans are focused on the numbers 1 and 0 -- the score line by which Germany defeated Argentina in the hard-fought contest Sunday in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Besides that, Alex Teixeira was in a place he needed to get out of. He had moved, together with a whole batch of fledging Brazilian players, to Shakhtar Donetsk when they were in their teens and Shakhtar’s billionaire owner had the money to put his Ukrainian team on the map of global soccer.
But the action doesn’t end there. Top finishers in the national tournament earn berths in the next year’s Libertadores Cup and South American Cup, two regional tournaments that run concurrently with parts of the state and national seasons. There’s also the Brazil Cup, a separate national competition with a knockout tournament format. And occasionally, the national team (that is, the one that goes to the World Cup) will play a “friendly” match against visiting foreign squads. (This year, from June 15 to 30, Brazil hosts the Confederations Cup, stopping league play.)
I don't recall the name of David's team, but it featured red uniforms and was coached by a local dad who worked as a fireman. He was a loud, boisterous guy, not unlike many of the fathers I see alongside fields most weekends in my hometown of New Rochelle, N.Y.
The road to the World Cup started over two years ago with more than 200 teams. Everyone got to play, even teams like American Samoa and the Maldives. Through a painfully long qualifying process, divided up by region, that initial pool whittled itself down to the group of 32 that will be in Brazil.
RIO DE JANEIRO ― At least two workers were killed on Wednesday when a construction crane collapsed at the stadium in São Paulo where Brazil plans to hold the opening game of next year’s World Cup, raising concerns over the country’s ability to finish an array of lavish arenas that have been plagued by delays and cost overruns.
Some players, for example, move when they are young and thus develop easy, deep ties to their new countries. Gui Lin, 22, who represented Brazil this summer, moved from China to Brazil at age 12 on an exchange program. She ended up staying to play table tennis.
“Brazil needs to learn to live with this,” said Thiago Scuro, the sporting director of Cruzeiro, which won the Brazilian championship in 2013 and 2014. “We were always a target, but what’s changed is the big clubs in Europe are taking very young players, to have time to develop them there. But China is signing the star players in their 20s.
The first-ever NBA games in China will take place October 14 and 17 when the Houston Rockets and the Sacramento Kings play preseason games in Beijing and Shanghai, it was announced by NBA Commissioner David Stern, together with Sun Kanglin, President of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Sport and Jin Guoxiang, President of the Shanghai Administration of Sports in Los Angeles.

As developed city of sports Shanghai is it say,can neglect attention in track andfield event either certainly to come,carried off the medal from Zhu Jianhua in thepast for the first time on the Olympic Games for our country,get to Liu Xiang oftoday and obtain column of 110 meters champion of Olympic Games,all make theillustrious battle achievement state-runly for Shanghai and me.
In one sense, the China conundrum is nothing new. But the earlier Brazilian star Júnior Baiano was already 31 when he went to Shanghai in 2001, and of the 134 reported moves of Brazilians to China from 2003 to 2010, almost all were players from minor clubs.
Not to be confused with the World Cup finals now underway in Brazil, this tournament took place last month in the northern Swedish city of Ostersund. As 203 national teams fought a two-and-a-half-year battle across six continents to qualify for Brazil, the Swedish tournament, called the Conifa World Cup, was played by national teams not recognized by FIFA, the sport’s governing body.
Brazil's 4-1 thrashing of Cameroon put the Seleção in the knockout stage of the Cup, where it will try to string together four consecutive victories for the championship. The hosts are the odds-on favorite to win, but sport bookies still put their chances at just one in three.
Sara Takanashi is being talked up as a hot favorite for gold in the women's ski jump, the first time the event has been included in the Olympics. Takanashi is only 17 years old but she is dominating the sport, winning 10 out of 13 events this season after being crowned world champion last year. The 5-foot tall student, who is coached by her father, Hiroya, has been dubbed The Big Small Jumper by the Japanese media. She says her hero is American ski jumper Sarah Hendrickson, whom she will be competing against in Sochi.
The loss, known as the Maracanaço (since used to refer to any loss by the national team on its home field), became a defining moment for Brazilian soccer. (For more on the game’s enduring impact, see Christoph Niemann’s animated feature, “Curse of Maracanã.”) Just last month, Pelé, a three-time World Cup winner himself, was still talking about the defeat as his earliest soccer memory and “the first time I’d seen so many people depressed and so many people crying.” He also told FIFA’s website: “I hope nobody comes and does what Ghiggia did. . . . I don’t want to remember 1950. I have to have confidence and believe in victory.”
If Brazil starts winning, some contend that optimism will surge around the first World Cup in the country since 1950, and easily exceed the low expectations. “People are worried about how much has been spent,” said José Evaraldo Bezerra, 48, a doorman at a residential building in Brasília. “But once we see the first game, the parties will start.”
I will always remember the moment when I presented the first Olympic gold medal at the Los Angeles Games in 1984 , because it was awarded to a Chinese athlete , Xu Haifeng and it was also the first Olympic gold medal to be won by a Chinese person in the Olympic history

from the laid-back beaches of rio de janeiro, which hosts the cup final, to the button-down streets of sao paulo, which hosts the opening match, this soccer-mad country is surprisingly subdued on the eve of hosting the world's largest sporting event, one that brazil has won a record five times.
his relentless aggressiveness inspired a generation of small, bulldog-esque guards, as los angeles clippers floor general chris paul told rowan kavner of the team's website back in february: "i just loved the grit that he played with. he always played with a chip on his shoulder. i feel like i sort of do the same."
a japanese research company called ale co. (aka star-ale) is bidding to put on a sensational pyrotechnics display for the opening ceremony of the 2020 summer olympics in tokyo. but this is no regular fireworks show: ale co.'s 'sky canvas' is an artificially created meteor shower – uh-huh – which would see hundreds of tiny, coloured fireballs rain down over the host city.
in ultraviolent restaurant in shanghai, fish and chips are served up to a backdrop of the beatles, while in el celler de can roca in girona, spain, scented meringue comes with a commentary describing barcelona footballer lionel messi in action, a clip which apparently brings out the citrus flavours in the dessert.
chinese clubs might not release players for national team play except in the mandatory official windows, edu said, before adding: “it’s a personal decision, but you need to balance it. and if you’re good enough and have the chance to play for brazil, nothing should get in the way.”
it was not nearly as artful as a messi free kick but it turned out to be the game-winner, and messi, whose four goals are tied for the tournament lead with brazil’s neymar, soon took a seat on the bench after being replaced in the 63d minute with an eye on preserving him for the second round.
antidoping officials from at least 10 nations and 20 athlete groups are preparing the extraordinary step of requesting that the entire russian delegation be barred from the summer olympics over allegations of a state-sponsored doping program, according to email correspondence obtained by the new york times.
chinese basketball icon yao ming, the chairman of the chinese basketball association (cba), showed up at the 2017 yangtze river delta professional basketball clubs challenge in shanghai late thursday, after an online rumor spread earlier in the day that he had been arrested for taking drugs, people’s daily online reported.
her success was one of the stand-out stories of the day at the olympic stadium where, earlier in the day, brazil’s teenage sensation petrucio ferreira dos santos had got the home crowd roaring as he smashed the world record to take gold in the men’s 100m t47
'it's a soft target, stretched out across 26 miles. it would be very difficult to secure,' said jim reese, a former u.s. army delta force officer whose security firm, tigerswan, is preparing a security plan for some brazilian clients ahead of the 2014 soccer world cup in rio de janeiro.
early on in this tournament, lang ping — who captured an olympic title with the 1984 chinese national team in los angeles then later spent a four-year stint coaching the americans — challenged her players to find ways to grow from their struggles with the world watching.
despite the overwhelming reaction from the brazilian fans, croatia, who was without its top scorer since mario mandzukic was suspended after getting a red card late in qualifying, did not buckle. instead, the blazers steadied their midfield early in the second half and looked to be comfortable playing for a tie as they bottled up the brazilians’ attempts to penetrate.
aidan reynolds, 18, was put forward by lynn davies, who captained team gb at moscow 1980 and los angeles 1984. aidan gave up a promising basketball career to focus on the javelin, winning three medals at national level at the english schools, uk school games and english championships.
in that sense, yao said, one of the great things to happen to chinese basketball is the emergence of harvard graduate and houston rockets ball handler jeremy lin, who stunned the world last year with a torrid stretch as an emergency fill-in point guard for the knicks.
the list of olympic participants targeted by brazilian boos is long and varied: russians, due to its doping scandal; spaniards, as symbols of latin american colonialism; a tennis ball boy who had butterfingers; favorites—like the poor romanian women’s handball team—when they played the underdogs; and, of course, anyone from brazil’s historic rival argentina, who probably get the worst of it.
disney enterprises, inc. and pixar, holders of the copyrights of animated comedies "cars" and "cars 2" as well as the character images, sued g-point in beijing, and bluemtv in xiamen, after they found the images, title and posters of animated movie "the autobots" resembled those of "cars" and "cars 2."
mike: well, from a young age, from about the age of twelve, i started doing karate in vancouver and i was training in karate for about seven or eight years and then once i graduated from high school i moved and i moved to japan and there i continued and didn't have much time to do training but i got involved in the kick boxing circle with some friends that did a lot of kick boxing and different types of martial arts.
the country is manufacturing a long list of world cup memorabilia--from figurines of the armadillo that serves as the games' official mascot to wigs, flags and caps. and who could forget the (chinese-made) vuvuzelas that cropped up when south africa hosted the last cup? this year, the country is stocking fans with an alternative instrument, the percussive brazilian caxirolas.
this week they were able to claim victory as politicians in japan's upper house of parliament voted to relax the law - part of a package of measures designed to ease deflationary pressures and to create a more relaxed atmosphere in the run-up to the 2020 olympics in tokyo.
the bad things derive from his role in one of the biggest gambling scandals in international baseball, a scheme in which tsai and several dozen other players in the chinese professional baseball league, which is the top-tier league in taiwan, were accused of throwing games from 2006 to 2009 in exchange for thousands of dollars from gamblers.
if that weren't enough pressure, this world cup has taken on an extra dimension as a social and political flash point in brazil since last year, when a million brazilians took to the streets to protest overspending to build cup stadiums while hospitals and schools go without.
“he’s kind of got it all: he’s good-looking, he’s a superstar, and brazil is a major force in the world cup regardless of what country that’s hosting it,” said will welch, the style editor at gq. “add in the fact that brazil is hosting the cup, and that’s just ramping it up even further.”
but instead of coming together to extol such triumphs on the global stage as the host of the world cup, the soccer tournament starting on thursday with teams from 32 countries, a grim mood is dividing many brazilians as resentment simmers over the ballooning costs of the mega-event and a sluggish post-boom economy saps optimism.
"we want to invite top figure skaters in the world to the tournament, all of them, in singles, doubles and ice dance," said huang, "we want shanghai trophy to become a ’grand prix’ of skating, include all the events of short track speedskating and figure skating."
evergrande was again the biggest spender, paying a c.s.l.-record $16.2 million for the brazilian ricardo goulart, but other clubs also made flashy deals, most notably shanghai sipg, which signed conca for a reported $10.8 million per year and hired the former england manager sven-goran eriksson as coach.
“we’ve seen massive investment in stadiums over the last 30 years, so it’s going to be a vastly different proposition than it was in 1984,” he said. “part of the problem for an l.a. bid is, it may be relatively cheap, but what would its legacy for the olympic movement and human development be?”
and, since the attacks, the anthem has been played at sporting events around the world, including at n.b.a. games at madison square garden, where the knicks played the new orleans pelicans, and at the staples center in los angeles, where the clippers played the detroit pistons, and at several n.h.l. games in canada.
guangzhou evergrande has won two of the past three asian champions league titles, and there is a rising number of famous coaches in the league, such as luiz felipe scolari, the 2002 world cup winner with brazil, and sven-goran eriksson, the former head coach of england’s national team.
shaq’s los angeles no. 34 is the only one of his four numbers to be retired by a team, as the lakers celebrated him in 2013. whether or not you think kobe is the greatest laker ever will be up for unending barroom debate, but i think just about everyone can agree on the idea that if anyone deserved two laker jerseys heading into the rafters, it would be the kobester. the lakers could still possibly find a way to find room on a hanging jersey for two numbers, but the staples center has plenty of room up there despite the lakers’ celebrated history – why not go nuts?
kevin: yes, actually, i do have a few memories because we spent probably three years there from the time i was born, obviously, until i was about two and a half or three years, we spent summers, or the baseball season in, in new york, and we rented a condominium on the second floor, and i remember, it was right across the street from la guardia airport, and so of course, when i was a little kid, one, one and two years old, i used to love sitting by the kitchen windows, and i even remember it was a bay window, the kind where you can roll the window open, and i used to roll the window open, and just watch the airplanes take off and land all day.
rodchenkov told the new york times that russian athletes had doped leading up to the 2008 beijing games, the 2012 london games and throughout the course of the 2014 sochi games, when russia controlled the olympic testing laboratory. he described an overnight operation in which he and a small team had substituted russian athletes’ tainted urine for clean urine, stockpiled in the months leading up to competition and passed surreptitiously through a hole in the wall of the lab building.
after alex teixeira’s move to liverpool fell through, and the brazilian was sold days later for $55 million to the chinese super league club jiangsu suning, the former liverpool defender mark lawrenson said in a liverpool newspaper that teixeira “must have the professional ambition of a gnat.”
los angeles — the 57th annual grammy awards on sunday were a mixture of old songs, new faces and upsets, as sam smith, a 22-year-old british singer barely known to american audiences a year ago, won three of the top four prizes, and beck became the dark-horse victor of album of the year.
the awards committee also gave “9.98” and “fujii fever” special prizes, recognizing the popularity and achievements of two astounding prodigies - students sprinter yoshihide kiryu, the first japanese to break the 100-meter race 10-second barrier at 9.98 seconds, and professional shogi player sota fujii, 14, who made history by winning 29 consecutive games.
with only three home runs to go to match oh’s feat and 26 games left in the season, balentien, 29, has a more than good chance to beat it ― and this time, the japanese appear happier, or at least resigned, to let the record fall.

for a team that did not exist until a dozen years ago, the ability to attract more than 28,000 fans on a cold tuesday evening in a city that offers plenty of entertainment alternatives was encouraging ― for the team, for shanghai and for chinese soccer in general.
after leading argentina to gold at the 2008 beijing olympics and a series of offseason tours in china with barcelona, messi has built a solid fan base, as demonstrated by chinese fans who mobbed his hotel on thursday afternoon before the event, hoping for a glimpse of their beloved star.
after alex teixeira’s move to liverpool fell through, and the brazilian was sold days later for $55 million to the chinese super league club jiangsu suning, the former liverpool defender mark lawrenson said in a liverpool newspaper that teixeira “must have the professional ambition of a gnat.”
at a recent practice in shanghai’s sprawling suburbs, shenhua’s latest marquee signing, the australian national team player tim cahill, bantered with the captain giovanni moreno of colombia and several chinese teammates in a mix of english, chinese and spanish. the team’s interpreters were kept busy as the goalkeepers’ coach, juan mesquida garcia, barked rapid-fire instructions in spanish, and the new manager, francis gillot, gave interviews to the news media in french.
organizers of the event, which now draws over twice the number of contestants as it did a decade ago, attribute that popularity to the enduring importance of politeness here, as well as a growing concern among some employers that younger japanese are forgetting their basic manners.
grigory rodchenkov, russia’s former anti-doping lab director, told the new york times in may that he covered up the use of performance-enhancing drugs by russian olympians at the 2014 sochi games, and that he did so under orders from russian officials for the ministry of sport.
